Program description
Using the LinkedList to stimulate a traffic light

Additional program detail:

1. use double link list and use the LinkedListAPI.h giving by proffessor;
2. In this double linkedlist, the head is NULL, which means list->head is always NULL
3. Look like NULL->NEXT->NEXT->NEXT which is easier to manipulate;
4. I make a struct readfile to read into info array first, and use qsort to sort it
5. when a car remove, I delete note from list, like a queue, first in first out.
